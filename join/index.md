# Join the Computational Ecology Lab
Our lab welcomes applicants from any backgrounds. Our mission is to develop a diverse an inclusive research environment in which you can develop your research in computational ecology, while having fun discussing science in the process. We aim at promoting constant scientific discussions and exchange of ideas in order to create a fertile and conducive research environment.

We are always in the market for motivated and talented people, even if we do not have an open position currently advertised. I am interested in engaging with you in a conversation about your scientific background and goals for your future career.
