# Join the Computational Ecology Lab
Our lab welcomes applicants from any backgrounds. Our mission is to provide you with the most conducive and fertile environment to conduct your research in computational ecology, while having fun discussing science in the process.

We are always in the market for motivated and talented people, even if we do not have an open position currently advertised. We are interested in engaging with you in a conversation about your scientific background and goals for your future career (in academia, industry, or other ventures).
