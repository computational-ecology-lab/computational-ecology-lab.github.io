This week the lab had a good representation at the Annual Meeting of the British Ecological Society in Liverpool!

We had the chance to showcase our work on many different projects currently ongoing.

Lucie delivered at great talk on her work on the **spatial spread of disturbances across spatially explicit food web metacommunities** as part of the Thematic session on **Dynamical Ecological Networks: Connecting topics and approaches**. Speakers in this session included Andrew Beckerman, Elisa Thébault and Ulrich Brose. All in all a great session!

Amelia attended her first BES conference, for which she was really excited, and had the chance to talk to people about her nice research on **changes in community composition of saline lagoons across tidal regimes** during her poster session.

Lastly, Gui and I were happy to present our current findings on theoretical approaches to microbial community assembly across scales from local to regional. This was part of the **Theoretical and Computational Ecology** parallel session on Wednesday. We are thankful for the support of the [Leverhulme Trust](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/) for the support to attend this conference under the Large Research Project Grant "The origin of complex symbioses".

Beyond the exciting talks and research sessions, the meeting was a great place to reconnect with colleagues and researchers from institutions across the world. It was nice to see familiar faces including Dani Montoya, Shai Pilosof, Fraser Januchowski-Hartley, Miguel Araújo, Vinicius Bastazini, Nathalie Cooper, Nathalie Pettorelli, Laura Graham, Ulrich Brose, Andrew Beckerman, Elisa Thébault, Chris Clements, Jason Matthiopoulos and many others!

**A great conference that we hope to attend again next year to keep showcasing the research done at the Computational Ecology Lab!**
