The link for the video recording and summary of my talk [***Modelling the assembly and disassembly of complex ecological systems***](https://sites.google.com/modelingtalks.org/entry/modelling-the-assembly-and-disassembly-of-complex-ecological-systems) at the [Modeling Talk Series](https://sites.google.com/modelingtalks.org/entry/home) of Google / Alphabet is now live!

In this talk I presented a summary of modelling work we have been conducting at the lab over the last few years in an effort to better understand how complex species interaction networks assemble and how they respond to different perturbations from warming and invasions to habitat loss.

There are also many other interesting talks in the series that are worth checking out!
