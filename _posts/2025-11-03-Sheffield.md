Today I had the pleasure to share my research on the modelling of complex ecosystems across scales with the researchers and students at the [School of Biosciences of the University of Sheffield](https://sheffield.ac.uk/biosciences/research/seminars).

In my talk on **Cross-scale community assembly: from microbiomes to spatial food webs**, I presented some of our recent findings on the eco-evolutionary theoretical framework we are developing to unveil the origins of complex symbioses. I then moved on to larger ecological scales and discussed some results on the spatial modelling of complex food webs and the effects of perturbations on their stability and organisation.

Before heading back to Swansea I had some time to check out the pair of peregrine falcon around St George's church!

**I would like to thank Oscar for the kind invitation and for organising the visit. Also, to Andrew and his group for the great discussions and the great dinner out after the seminar. Hope to visit again soon!**
