This week Lucie travelled to Belfast to present her most recent findings on the effects of disturbances on meta food webs at the [2023 Annual Meeting of the British Ecological Society](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/events/bes-annual-meeting-2023/)!

An excellent representation of the current research in our lab. It was very well received and Lucie got many interesting questions and comments.
