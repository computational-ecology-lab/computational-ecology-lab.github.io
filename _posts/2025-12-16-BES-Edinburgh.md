This week I once again had the pleasure to share the lab's research with scientists from around the world at the [Annual Meeting of the BES](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/content/bes-annual-meeting-2025/), this year in Edinburgh!

With countless interesting talks and posters, thematic sessions and just the vibrant atmosphere, this meeting is always a chance to catch up with friends and colleagues on the latest developments of our research and have fun while doing it. This year, I also contributed in other ways by joining a **focus group** where we discussed the impact of the Annual Meeting on our research and on ecological science. Thanks Rachel for the chance to join this group!

I also chaired a session on **Evolutionary Ecology: Plasticity, dispersal and ecological responses** which was full of interesting talks and discussions from the impact of adaptive dispersal on population persistence to the evolution of sex ratios in breeding systems.

During my poster presentation on the **Coevolutionary drivers of phylosymbiosis and microbiome divergence in host-microbe associations**, I had the chance to discuss with several interesting people our ideas on the origins of complex symbioses and how we can develop quantitative mathematical models to better understand them.

Before heading back to Swansea I had some time to check out the Christmas market and other nice sightings in the city centre of Edinburgh. A very nice town! And of course, to head down to the pub, or catch up at the venue, with old friends from all over the world.

**Thanks to the Leverhulme Trust (through project grant RPG-2022-114) for the support to attend and present my work at this meeting.**
