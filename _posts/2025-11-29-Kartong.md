For a few days this November I was very lucky to be part of a research expedition to the [Kartong Bird Observatory](https://kartongbirdobservatory.com/) in The Gambia. I had the opportunity to learn more about the projects they are running from the population genetics of a couple of species of vultures (Hooded *Necrosyrtes monachus* and White-backed *Gyps africanus*) to the migration patterns and wintering ecology of nightingales *Luscinia megarhynchos*. Many inspirational ideas emerged from this for potential future research projects at Kartong touching the applied side of the research we develop at the Computational Ecology Lab.

The expedition was a success, with around 3450 individual birds from 154 different species recorded. These data constitute a valuable contribution to bird research in The Gambia and more generally for a better understanding of bird populations worldwide.

As an added bonus I enjoyed very much the ringing and the birdwatching, with so many species observed in amazing habitats. I had the opportunity to join ringing teams both on terrestrial as well as wetland and estuarine environments. Everyday presented new chances to see and experience different locations and different species, from the **massive flocks of Western Reef *Egretta gularis*, Black *Egretta ardesiaca*, Striated *Butorides striata*, Squacco *Ardeola ralloides* and Black-headed *Ardea melanocephala* herons  that roamed the grasslands of Batabar**, to the Grey *Pluvialis squatarola*, Common Ringed *Charadrius hiaticula* and White-fronted *Charadrius marginatus* plovers as well as Whimbrels *Numenius phaeopus* and Common *Actitis hypoleuca*, Green *Tringa ochropus* and Wood *Tringa glareola* sandpipers of the **coastal and mangrove habitats of Barracunto and Stala**. Not to mention the **beautifully coloured birds found across the entire reserve** such as Little *Merops pusillus*, Blue-cheeked *Merops persicus* and Swallow-tailed *Merops hirundineus* bee-eaters, Yellow-crowned Gonoleks *Laniarius barbarus*, Senegal Coucal *Centropus senegalensis*, Beautiful Sunbird *Cinnyris pulchellus*, Red-cheeked Cordonbleu *Uraeginthus bengalus* amongst many others!

On the personal side, beyond the ringing, it was great to get to meet and interact with an incredible team of researchers and expert ornithologists such as Michael, Emmanuel, Naffie, Olly, Roger, and many others. I am really grateful for their guidance and the knowledge imparted during the expedition. It was great to be part of the team.

I had an amazing time as part of the Swamp Squad, paddling around puddles and getting into deep ponds for which my thigh waders were not enough! Always in the search for nice species such as White-faced whistling ducks *Dendrocygna viduata*, Greater Painted-snipe *Rostratula benghalensis*, and of course Ospreys *Pandion haliaetus*!

**Thanks to all the team for an unforgettable experience and especially to the Swamp Squad, my bro Billy who was always making the time enjoyable, and the people of Kartong! Hope to be back soon.**
