This summer, Marco participated as a tutor at the [Konstanz Summer School of Collective Behaviour 2025](https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/kscb/). He met a lot of wonderful students from all over the world and had a chance to learn from great scientists about a wide range of topics related to collective behaviour and quantitative skills. 

He gave a tutorial on dynamical systems, which he learned by attending another great [Graduate School on Control](http://www.eeci-igsc.eu/doc/users/975/bib/2025/eeciigsc2025summaries.pdf) organised by [Dr Anastasia Bizyaeva](https://anastasiabzv.github.io/) and [Dr Alessio Franci](https://sites.google.com/site/francialessioac/).

Dynamical systems are a great tool (with some cautions to be considered) to increase one's intuition about decision-making. In spite of this, physicists, biologists and cognitive scientists are usually not taught some of the most important and incredible features of these techniques, like bifurcations and unfoldings. Marco recently presented a version of [this tutorial](https://github.com/MarcoFele98/KSCB_2025)at our **Friday modelling coffee sessions**. Despite the wonderful teachers he had during the summer schools he takes full ownership on potential mistakes of the material included in his tutorial and hopes you enjoy going over the notes!
