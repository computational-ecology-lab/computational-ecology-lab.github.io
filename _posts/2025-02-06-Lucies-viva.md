Today Lucie defended her PhD thesis and became a Dr after passing her viva with minor corrections.

Her thesis entitled ***Conservation and disturbance of complex food webs across spatial scales*** encompassed a range of interesting studies about the effects of different anthropogenic disturbances on the the structure of complex food webs.

She had the pleasure to have [Dr Elisa Th√©bault](https://iees-paris.fr/annuaire/thebault-elisa/) from the Sorbonne University and [Dr Laura Graham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/gees/people/profile?ReferenceId=190301) from the University of Birmingham as the external examiners. They had a very interesting discussion about Lucie's work and joined us for celebrations afterwards!

**Congratulations Lucie!**
