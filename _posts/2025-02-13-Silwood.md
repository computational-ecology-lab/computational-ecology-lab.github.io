Today I am visiting the Silwood Park Campus of Imperial College London, where I was invited to present the lab's research on **Ecological networks across scales from micro to macro** in a research seminar as part of the [Ecology and Evolution Seminar Series at Silwood Park](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/silwood-park/events/thursday-seminars/).

I had great interesting discussions with [Prof Samraat Pawar](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/s.pawar), my host over there at Silwood on the modelling of coalescent microbial communities. We  discussed interesting ideas related to one of his recent papers on [the role of competition and cooperation in these complex systems](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009584) with her Masters student Jinyie. Synergies between our research were immediately apparent and we hope to collaborate in the future on these ideas!

I also had the chance to catch up with [Tom Bell](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/thomas.bell) and [Bonnie Waring](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/b.waring), on topics related to the assembly of microbial communities in vivo and in vitro. They have very exciting research going on with amazing experimental setups.

**Thanks Samraat for the great day at Silwood!**
