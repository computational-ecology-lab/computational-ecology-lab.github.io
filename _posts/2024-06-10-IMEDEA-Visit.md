This week we are at the [Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies (IMEDEA) of the CSIC](https://imedea.uib-csic.es/) in Mallorca! Thanks to the Maria de Maetzu Visiting Scholar Programme, I was able to spend some time here and discuss some exciting research with [Research Professor Anna Traveset](https://www.travesetlab.com/) on the ecology and biogeography of pollination and seed-dispersal networks.

Lucie joined us for a couple of days and she also had the change to discuss with Anna and members of her group the exciting research they are doing as well as Lucie's own work on the modelling of the spread of disturbance on spatially extended food webs.

Anna kindly organised for me to give a seminar on **Understanding the network structure of ecosystems to guide conservation action** where I shared our current research on microbial communities and the understanding of the effects of protected areas on food web structure.

We not only enjoyed the research but also the amazing food and some afternoon hikes around the Esporles surroundings!

**Thanks to Anna, Isa, Alba, Max, Andrea, Manolo, Giacomo and many people @ IMEDEA for the great times!**
