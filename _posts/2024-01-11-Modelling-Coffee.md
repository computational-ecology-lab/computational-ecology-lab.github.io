This Friday 12th of January, we resume our activities of the modelling coffee, continuing a tutorial presentation about stochastic calculus, 
**Gentle introduction to stochastic calculus for population dynamics**, by Gui Araujo. 

The topics of this week are differential equation models, such as Fokker-Planck and Langevin equations, and a discussion on the concept of 
noise and the differences between intrinsic and extrinsic noise.
