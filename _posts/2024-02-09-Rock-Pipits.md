Our work on the colour ringing project of Rock Pipits along the coast of Gower, and funded by the 
[British Ecological Society](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/funding/research-grants/past-awards-research-grants/), 
was featured on the [Gower Ornithological Society's Annual report](https://www.gowerbirds.org.uk/the-ringing-year-2023-gower-ringing-group/)!

So far we have mapped several territores, with many re-sights of marked birds. We are currently using the data collected from these observations 
to build a theoretical model to better understand the landscape-scale consequences of local individual behaviour in territorial species!

If you want to know more about this species, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) has an incredible wealth of information on 
[rock pipits](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/rock-pipit) and other species.

This project is supported by the [Gower Ringing Group](https://www.gowerbirds.org.uk/category/gower-ringing-group/) and the 
[British Trust of Ornithology](https://www.bto.org/understanding-birds/birdfacts/rock-pipit) (BTO), to which this project contributes data.
