description: "I graduated in Ecology and Evolution at the university of Groningen and did my thesis at the University of Lausanne, investigating collective decision-making in ants using individual-based simulations.


In Swansea, I am investigating the collective behavior of different model species, to see how individual heterogeneity impacts group behaviour. I plan to implement some of the insights gained form studying biological systems in robotic swarms.


When I am not busy playing with models, I am usually either rock-climbing, hiking, or looking at plants."
