description: "I am a PhD student here at Computational Ecology Lab, investigating the project ***Harnessing ecosystem resilience to inform woodland restoration across Wales***.


I am a biogeographer specializing in modeling the distribution of species and biodiversity. Before coming to Swansea, I completed my master's thesis at Uppsala University, where I focused on integrating the spatial configuration (e.g., heterogeneity, complexity) of environmental factors as predictors in biodiversity distribution modeling. These predictive models are often 'black boxes' and difficult to interpret. 


Currently, my goal is to explore theoretical models and simulation approaches to better understand how different facets of biodiversity—such as species richness, genetic diversity, and interaction complexity—are maintained under varying spatial configurations. I am also interested in examining how existing species distribution models perform in small-scale research areas like Wales, and in seeking ways to improve their reliability and explanatory power.


I enjoy traveling, hiking, watching movies, reading poems, learning languages and enjoying a cup of coffee."
