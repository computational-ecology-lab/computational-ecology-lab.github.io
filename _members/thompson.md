description: "I completed an engineering degree in agronomy at Lâ€™Institut Agro and a master in ecological modelling at the university of Rennes (France). I specialise in spatial ecology and ecological networks, with a growing interest for theoretical and system ecology.  


Alongside Dr Miguel Lurgi, Prof. Emily Shepard and Dr Konstans Wells, we use empirical (bird occurrence data) and theoretical approaches (metacommunity models) to understand how anthropogenic disturbances modulate food web assembly. Our work focuses notably on the capacity of protected areas at shielding food webs from disturbances. 


I am a big outdoors lover and can usually be found running, swimming or climbing outside office hours."
