description: "Miguel was an undergraduate at Simón Bolívar University, where he worked in the Artificial Intelligence Group under the supervision of Dr. Hector Palacios on the development of a **Constraint Programming Language for C++**. He graduated with **Cum Laude** honours in **BEng Computer Engineering** in 2003.


After a year working as Software Developer for the project CARIACO at the Institute for Marine Sciences and Technologies of the Simón Bolívar University, he moved to Brighton, UK and completed an **MSc in Evolutionary and Adaptive Systems** at the **University of Sussex**. At Sussex, under the supervision of Dr Inman Harvey, he investigated the role of **classical conditioning in evolutionary robotics**, following thus his longstanding passion for bio-inspired computation and evolutionary theory, which had started a few years earlier when as an undergraduate student he became acquainted with subjects such as genetic algorithms, autonomous multi-agent systems, and neural networks.


In 2009, Miguel and his close friend Francesc Estanyol co-developed a project proposal to design and implement a **multi-agent digital business ecosystem**. In this way, they combined both their interests (ecological systems, Miguel; and business, Francesc) to develop a research idea that would be funded by the **Marie Skłodowska Curie Actions of the European Commission**. Thanks to this award, Miguel was able to join the **School of Informatics** of the **University of Edinburgh**, Scotland, UK, as a Marie Curie Research Associate. Under the supervision of Dr Dave Robertson, Miguel developed the foundations of an ecologically inspired multi-agent system borrowing ideas from ecology and evolution. These efforts granted him an **MRes in Artificial Intelligence** and seeded his interests in what would become his main research focus to date: networks of ecological interactions.


The experiences and knowledge gained in Edinburgh prompted Miguel to embark in a radical career change: **from artificial intelligence to ecology**. He was determined to continue his research career as an ecologist investigating natural communities and ecosystems from the perspective of complex networks. With this goal in mind, Miguel started developing a knowledge base on ecological systems and initiated communication with a research scientist who would become to be not only his PhD advisor, but a lifelong colleague and friend: Dr José Montoya. Miguel started working with Jose and Dr Bernat Claramunt-López (who would also become a longlife friend) on the development of a deeper understanding of the effects of climate change on networks of species interactions. Together with Jose, Miguel developed a research proposal to obtain funds to do his PhD investigating **The Assembly and Disassembly of Ecological Networks in a Changing World**. It was with this idea that Miguel received a PhD scholarship from **Microsoft Research** to complete his PhD studies at the **Centre for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications** at the **Autonomous University of Barcelona** and the **Marine Sciences Institute** of the **Spanish Research Council (CSIC)**. Miguel obtained his PhD with **Cum Laude** honours in 2014.


Right after finishing his PhD, Miguel took a postdoctoral position at the **School of Biological Sciences** at the **University of Adelaide**, Australia. During his time in Australia, he investigated the effects of invasive species management on complex ecosystems. Taking a complex network modelling approach to ecosystems dynamics, Miguel uncovered the effects of management actions on the different species embedded in a complex community across trophic levels. In 2016, after his Australian experience, Miguel came back to Europe to join his former advisor and good friend Dr José Montoya. Miguel became a postdoctoral researcher at the **Centre for Biodiversity Theory and Modelling** of the **Theoretical and Experimental Ecology Station** of the **CNRS** in Moulis, France. At the CNRS Miguel developed a comprehensive research programme into the assembly and disassembly of complex ecosystems across spatial scales and ecosystems. His research on the structure of the microbiome associated to multicellular hosts, alongside the continent-wide spatial scaling and variability of terrestrial vertebrate and marine invertebrate complex ecological systems, allowed him to uncover key ecological and evolutionary processes behind the emergence of these communities. These empirical studies were complemented with theoretical models to gain a better understanding of the effect of different aspects of global change on complex networks of species interactions.


In 2019, Miguel joined the **Department of Biosciences** at **Swansea University**, where he founded the **Computational Ecology Lab**. The research focus of the lab remains the fundamental understanding of the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms behind the assembly and disassembly of complex ecosystems. Miguel tackles these challenges using a combination of empirical analyses of large and complex datasets on both microbial and macrobial commuinities, and theoretical models incorporating dynamics in complex networks and the processes that are believed to be behind their emergence.

Outside of lab, Miguel enjoys long birdwatching and mountain biking."
