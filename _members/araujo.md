description: "I’m a physicist with training in statistical mechanics. My research after graduating has been mainly concerned with modeling diverse questions in theoretical ecology while developing methods in population dynamics and evolutionary game theory.


My project at the Computational Ecology Lab consists of developing a metacommunity framework for the eco-evolutionary assembly of complex ecological communities and then applying these methods to the assembly of host-microbiome communities. In particular, we are interested in analyzing sponge microbiome data.


I like all things related to games and game design, both digital and board games, and I’m an indie game developer. I also play the keyboard and I’m a lover of ethnic percussion and minimal music."
