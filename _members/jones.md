description: "I previously studied Marine Biology (BSc) and took part in multiple field projects including one studying the territorial behaviour of Damselfish. I also conducted my third year research project on the impact of environment vs genetics on the behaviour of the self fertilising killifish *Kryptolebias marmoratus*.


For my masters research project I am conducting field research in saline ponds looking at community composition during different stages of flooding.


Outside of university I enjoy surfing and swimming, I also enjoy diving and recently went to Fiji where I saw zebra sharks and manta rays.
