description: "I am a Ph.D. candidate in ecology at São Paulo University (USP, Brazil) currently conducting research at the Center for Advanced Systems Understanding (CASUS-HZDR), in Görlitz, Germany. With a background in physics (BSc and MSc), I have been constructing mathematical and computational models to understand ecological systems since my undergraduate studies. 


My research focuses on understanding the population and community-wide consequences of organism-level behavior, particularly in relation to movement. Alongside Miguel Lurgi and Ricardo Martinez-Garcia, we are investigating how local interactions between conspecifics can change broad scale dispersal patterns. I believe that interdisciplinary collaboration is the only way we can make sense of a complex world, and I have presented my work at various conferences and events.


In my free time, I enjoy traveling, meeting new people, and experiencing different cultures. I also enjoy hiking, drinking tea, and playing chess, although I admit to being quite uninspired in the latter.
