description: "I am a PhD student at the Centre for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications (CREAF) at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, under the supervision of Dr Bernat Claramunt-López, head of the [MountainLab](https://www.creaf.cat/mountainlab-mtnlab-research-and-development-mountain-systems) and Dr Miguel Lurgi. I hold a BSc degree in Biology and a MSc degree in Ecology and Environmental Management and Restoration, both from the University of Barcelona. During the final year of my BSc degree, I did my thesis in Plant Ecology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.


I started working at CREAF with my MSc thesis, analysing a Pyrenean river basin as a mountain social-ecological system. I am interested in understanding current and future sustainability challenges in mountain areas. In my PhD, I am studying the interactions between social, economic and environmental components in different mountain social-ecological systems in Europe. Our approach involves both analysing empirical mountain data and system dynamics modelling.  


When I am not at my computer, I enjoy cooking, hiking and learning new crafts."
