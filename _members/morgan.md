description: "In my prior education, I gained a BSc (Hons) in Biosciences at Swansea University, researching the effect that regular habitat disturbance had on grassland habitats. 
I also undertook a number of professional conservation reports including Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Reports, Phase 1 Habitat Surveys and a River Habitat Survey. 


During my masters research project, under the supervision of Dr Penny Neyland and Miguel, I undertook a modelling study to analyze the distribution of nine rare endemic hyperoceanic bryophytes in the UK. 
The research consisted of modelling the current distribution of these species in the UK and the anticipated distributions under a future adverse climate change scenario.  


In my spare time I enjoy the process of active management of several investment portfolios, utilizing optimization strategies 
and employing rigorous risk management techniques. I am also committed to my physical wellbeng through long distance running and weightlifting activities.
