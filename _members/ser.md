description: "I am a PhD student at the Computational Ecology Lab at Swansea University, co-supervised by Dr Miguel Lurgi and Dr Steve Slocombe. My PhD explores the dynamics of microbial assembly both ***in vitro*** and ***in silico*** specifically in the context of algal bioreactors.


In 2022, I completed my BSc in Biological Sciences from Imperial College London. My undergraduate thesis modelled the niches of two symbiotic species: Norway Spruce and the fungus *Russula ochroleuca*.


In 2024, I obtained my MSc in Computational Modelling in Ecology and Evolution from Imperial College London. During my thesis project I investigated how ecosystem function could be maximised through assembly manipulation in microbial systems using a modelling approach.


In my free time I enjoy gaming, cooking, baking and reading."
