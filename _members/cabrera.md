description: "I'm a Master student in Biodiversity, Operation and Management of Ecosystems at the University of the Basque Country (Spain). My thesis is jointly supervised by [Dr Isabel Donoso](https://www.ikerbasque.net/en/isabel-donoso), research fellow at [BC3](https://www.bc3research.org/) in Bilbao and Miguel. My research focuses on understanding the drivers of variability in the structure of plant-frugivore interaction networks and the dispersion of seeds by birds.

I'm a biologist graduated from the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic), where I did my thesis about a population study of *Trachemys stejnegeri vicina*. I have participated as a research assistant in the Project of the Impact of Climate Variability in *Strombus pugilis* populations, in addition to working closely on biological fisheries and aquaculture topics, as well as in areas such as herpetology and ornithology, carrying out monitoring in urban parks and protected areas.
