description: "Sion is an MRes student at the Computational Ecology Lab, investigating the spatial use and behavioural responses of a moose population to human-driven environmental change in Canada.


His project is supervised by Dr. Miguel Lurgi and Prof. Jim Bull, in collaboration with the [John Prince Research Forest](https://www.jprf.ca/) in northern British Columbia, Canada. The project focuses on questions related to moose populations in the research forest's study area, with a particular interest in movement patterns and energy landscapes derived from camera trap data.


Sion is an alumnus of Swansea University, having graduated in BSc Zoology with a year in industry.


In his spare time, he enjoys hiking, graphic design, guitar, and videography."
