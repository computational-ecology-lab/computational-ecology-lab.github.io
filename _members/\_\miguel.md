description: "Miguel obtained his **BEng in Computer Engineering** in 2003 at the Simón Bolívar University (Caracas, Venezuela), for which he was awareded **Cum Laude** honours. 
He did his thesis, entitled: **A Constraint Programming Language for C++** under the supervision of Dr. Héctor Palacios.
He was a member of the Artificial Intelligence Group, working on robotics, neural networks, genetic algorithms and individual-based models.


In 2004, Miguel moved to Brighton, UK and completed an **MSc in Evolutionary and Adaptive Systems** at the **University of Sussex**. 
At Sussex, under the supervision of Dr Inman Harvey, he investigated the role of **Classical Conditioning in Evolutionary Robotics**.


In 2009, Miguel joined the **School of Informatics** of the **University of Edinburgh**, Scotland, UK, as a **Marie Skłodowska Curie Research Associate**. Under the supervision of Dr Dave Robertson, Miguel developed the foundations of an ecologically inspired multi-agent system borrowing ideas from ecology and evolution. These efforts granted him an **MRes in Artificial Intelligence** and seeded his interests in what would become his main research focus to date: networks of ecological interactions.


In 2011, Miguel received a PhD scholarship from **Microsoft Research** to complete his PhD studies at the **Centre for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications** at the **Autonomous University of Barcelona** and the **Marine Sciences Institute** of the **Spanish Research Council (CSIC)** under the supervision of Dr José Montoya and Dr Bernat Claramunt-López.
For his thesis **The Assembly and Disassembly of Ecological Networks in a Changing World**, Miguel obtained his PhD with **Cum Laude** honours in 2014.


Right after finishing his PhD (2014), Miguel took a postdoctoral position at the **School of Biological Sciences** at the **University of Adelaide**, Australia. 
During his time in Australia, he investigated the effects of invasive species management on ecosystems through a complex networks modelling approach.
In 2016, his Australian experience came to an end, and Miguel returned to Europe to join his former advisor and good friend Dr José Montoya as a postdoctoral researcher at the **Centre for Biodiversity Theory and Modelling** of the **Theoretical and Experimental Ecology Station** of the **CNRS** in Moulis, France. 
At the CNRS Miguel developed a comprehensive research programme into the assembly and disassembly of complex ecosystems across spatial scales and ecosystems. 


In 2019, Miguel joined the **Department of Biosciences** at **Swansea University**, where he founded the **Computational Ecology Lab**. 
The research focus of the lab remains the fundamental understanding of the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms behind the assembly and disassembly of complex ecosystems. 
Miguel tackles these challenges using a combination of empirical analyses of large and complex datasets on both microbial and macrobial commuinities, and theoretical models incorporating dynamics in complex networks and the processes that are believed to be behind their emergence.


Outside of lab, Miguel enjoys birdwatching and mountain biking."
