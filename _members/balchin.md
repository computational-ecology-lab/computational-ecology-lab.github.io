description: "I am a Year in Applied Research (YiAR) student with the SHOAL research group at Swansea University, under the supervision of Dr Andrew King. This is a sandwich year in between the second and final year of my BSc Marine Biology degree, in which I have been assisting with a number of research projects including those on collective movement and wildlife population modelling. 


Currently I am working alongside Dr Miguel Lurgi, Dr Andrew King, and another YiAR student Jude Lynch to create a population model of chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. To do so we are using census reports of managed troops within this geographically isolated population, aiming to understand it’s demographic processes and assess the sustainability of management practices. 


Outside of my work I’m a big fan of wild swimming, I’ve been a committee member for my university’s scuba diving club for several years, and my biggest current travel goal is to free dive with humpback whales.
