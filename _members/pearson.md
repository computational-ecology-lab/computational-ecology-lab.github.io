description: "I am a PhD student at Swansea University, with the Restoration Ecology and Dynamics (READY) Doctoral Focal Award. My research focuses on measuring and modelling the future persistence of restored peatlands at their bioclimatic range limits. I am supervised by Prof Cindy Froyd, Dr Miguel Lurgi and Prof Bernd Kulessa.


I previously completed an MRes at Swansea University, where I investigated long-term vegetation and wildfire dynamics in the high Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest, USA. Prior to this I was at Durham University for my BSc in Biological Sciences where I examined palaeoecological signatures in UK blanket bogs.


Outside of my research, I enjoy camping and hiking, as well as cooking and sewing."
