# Computational Ecology Lab Courses

Teaching Ecological Theory is one of my favourite activities. Especially focusing on networks of ecological interactions.

I am supporter of the learning-by-doing philosophy of teaching. To encourage this in students I have put together a series of online resources:

- To learn more about theoretical ecology: [https://padlet.com/miguel_lurgi/me9sk6j2firo](https://padlet.com/miguel_lurgi/me9sk6j2firo)


- A entry level tutorial for single population dynamics can be found here: [https://computational-ecology-lab.github.io/single-population-workshop/populations-workshop.html](https://computational-ecology-lab.github.io/single-population-workshop/populations-workshop.html)


- To develop coding skills for analysing ecological networks: [https://mlurgi.github.io/networks_for_r/](https://mlurgi.github.io/networks_for_r/)


- To learn different techniques to analyse different types of ecological networks in community ecology: [https://mlurgi.github.io/serrapilheira_eco_networks/](https://mlurgi.github.io/serrapilheira_eco_networks/)


This last resource was developed as part of the Community Ecology and Biodiversity module that I was invited to deliver for the [Training Program in Quantitative Biology and Ecology](https://www.ictp-saifr.org/qbioprogram/) at the [International Centre for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ictp-saifr.org/) in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, in September 2022.

I believe that the best way to learn is by doing and discussing passionately about science. So, please feel free to drop me a line or by my office with any interesting questions or topics about pretty much anything.

Current topics that interest me include: complex systems - philosophy of science - observations of rare birds - the Hutchinsonian niche - geographical ecology...

## Population and Community Ecology

I coordinate the course for Y2 undergraduate students **Population and Community Ecology** at the Biosciences Department of Swansea University. 
In this course, students are exposed to theoretical modelling in ecology. 
We cover a wide range of very interesting topics from single population exponential and logistic growth models all the way to dynamics in complex multispecies predator-prey networks.
We also devote sometime to one of my main scientific interests: geographical ecology.
