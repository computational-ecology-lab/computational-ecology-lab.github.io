Research in the lab is focused on discovering the mechanisms behind the **emergence of structure and organisation of complex ecological networks**. We study systems from microbial to macro communities of terrestrial vertebrate, with the ultimate goal of understanding the assembly and disassembly of ecosystems.

We address these challenges from a **computational perspective** centred around **two main axes: theoretical modelling and analysis of large complex datasets**. We are interested in developing theoretical models to understand and predict the behaviour of complex ecosystems from first principles and how they will respond to change. We also aim at revealing patterns of organisation of complex communities from large datasets of empirical systems.
